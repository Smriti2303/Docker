# 🐳 **Docker Basics: Hello World**

Welcome to **Docker Basics: Hello World!** 🚀  
This is my first hands-on step into the world of containerization. In this project, I containerized a simple Python app that prints **"Hello, World!"** — a foundational exercise to learn how Docker works under the hood.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project includes:

- A minimal Python app (`app.py`)
- A `Dockerfile` to define the image build
- A `docker-compose.yml` to simplify container orchestration
- Supporting files like `.dockerignore` and `requirements.txt`

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Make sure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Python (optional, for local app testing)

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1️⃣ Clone or Create the Project Folder

If you're building this manually:
```bash
mkdir docker-hello-world
cd docker-hello-world
